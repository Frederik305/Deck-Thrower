## Gameplay

Fight waves of enemies and build up you deck with killer cards. Throw these cards at your enemies to defeat them and live to see another round.

At the start of each round, select a card to add to your inventory, then fight off the randomly spawned wave of enemies. After losing all of your health, the game is over!

#### There are multiple card types with unique abilities:
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/900e52da-4cd0-4d53-998b-424cff1c1213"> The Default- The classic, no frills card that gets the job done
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f702093b-5a0e-4e45-b37a-4c4e6826bcc4"> The Bouncy- This sporty card will visit every corner of the map in a mad dash to bounce off of as much as possible
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08de2c95-c5e2-4971-9728-8692d85f330d"> The Baby- Tiny, quick, and deadly, this little friend will make quick work of any crowd (but good luck finding him again!)
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/644fd78e-dda7-4d19-bd97-b374ca7e95c2"> The Anvil- A card so beefy that gravity affects it...crush your foes and set up impenetrable walls with this sturdy asset
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f76ba8-8ef3-4d1a-b96c-b296d5a529d3"> The Boomerang- The most loyal card one can ask for, this card will make its way back to your hand after throwing it
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d964fd22-0e22-4f8a-9353-e1d886c290f5"> The Random- The wildcard (literally), this card will be thrown with a random speed, size, and damage...only for those fond of gambling

- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db59499-abe2-43ca-ba27-94a119d46ce3"> The Follower- These guys will make a mad dash towards you, ignoring anything between you and them
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56ae83af-1189-425a-a8ee-645eb0205258"> The Bouncer- These not-so-gentle giants will blindly bounce all over the room, crashing into any and every thing there is (including you!)
- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dca57d6-8035-4a37-a6cd-731a723489e2"> The Shooter- These guys will fire bouncy bullets at you to keep you on your toes, even if you're across the map
